# Live Project: Job-Placement-Dashboard
Azure DevOps - Remote Collaboration Project

## Introduction
For the last two weeks at The Tech academy, I worked as a Remote Developer on a 6-Member Development Team for Prosper IT Consulting, LLC. We all worked to build off of an existing, MVC-C# Web Application Program (using the Code-First Entity Framework) that was mid-cycle in its development. This was a great learning experience for New Code Implementation + Debugging in Visual Studio on a much larger scale, as well as Development Collaboration, while at the direction of a Project Manager in Azure DevOps and Slack. 

Below are descriptions and screenshots (SS) of the stories I worked on during our sprint.

## Front-End Stories
### Style Changes to Navbar

Product Backlog Item 3660: 
I was referred to another website with similar Navbar styles that the client wanted implemented into their Navbar. I was instructed to use the exact color #Blue Backround + #Orange Text as was seen on the 'donor' site.

## Back-End Stories
### GUID Implementation

Product Backlog Item 3585: 
In the JPApplication Create view, remove the field for student_id. In the JPApplicationController, add the id of the current user to the JPstudent object before it is saved to the database.
