Azure DevOps - Remote Collaboration Project

## Introduction
For the last two weeks at The Tech academy, I worked as a Remote Developer on a 6-Member Development Team for Prosper IT Consulting, LLC. We all worked to build off of an existing, MVC-C# Web Application Program (using the Code-First Entity Framework) that was mid-cycle in its Development Process. This was a great learning experience for Development Collaboration, while diving into New Code Implementation and Debugging on a much larger scale at the direction of a Project Manager in Azure DevOps and Slack. 

Below are descriptions and screenshots (SS) of the stories I worked on during our sprint.
